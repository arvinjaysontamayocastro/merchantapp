# S07 Angular Basics

# S07 E063 Introduction
    Adding components
    Http client module
    Observables
    Typescript

    Goal:

    To be able to use the http client to retrieve data from the API.

    To understand the basics of observables and Typescript.

# S07 E068 Introduction to observables
    Observable
        a sequence of items that arrive asynchronously over time.

    Promises
        has one pipeline
        typically used with async data return
        not easy to cancel
    
    Observable
        are cancellable
        stream data in multiple pipelines
        array like operations
        can be created from other sources like events
        they can be subscribed to
    
    HTTP, Observables and RxJS
        HTTP Get requests from ShopService
        Angular Service receives the observable and cast it into Products array
        Subscribe to the Observable from the component
        Assign the Products array to a local variable for use in the components template

    RxJS
        Reactive extensions for Javascript
        Utility library for working with observables, similar to lodash or underscore for javascript objects and arrays
        Uses the pipe() method to chain RxJS operators together

# S07 E069 Introduction to TypeScript
    Typescript
        Strong Typing
        Object Orientated
        Better Intellisense
        Access Modifiers
        Future Javascript features
        Catches silly mistakes in developmenet
        3rd party libraries
        Easy to learn if you know JS

# S07 E070 Typescript demo
    npx tsc src/demo.ts
    node src/demo.js
